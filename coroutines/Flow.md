By default, flows are *sequential* and all flow operations are executed sequentially in the same coroutine, with an exception for a few operations specifically designed to introduce concurrency into flow execution such as [buffer](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/buffer.html) and [flatMapMerge](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/flat-map-merge.html).
